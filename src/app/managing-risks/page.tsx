              <li>
                <strong>Accidents are preventable:</strong> Most workplace incidents result from unaddressed risks or
                lack of awareness. Training empowers staff to recognize and respond to hazards.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Injuries impact everyone:</strong> A single injury can disrupt teams, delay production, and
                damage morale. Proactive risk assessments target root causes before incidents occur.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lost time is costly:</strong> Downtime from injuries or investigations costs more than just
                productivity ‚Äî it can harm your brand, customer trust, and team culture.
